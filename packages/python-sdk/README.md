# Python SDK (Planned)

This directory is reserved for the upcoming Starcite Python SDK.

Planned layout:

- `packages/python-sdk/pyproject.toml`
- `packages/python-sdk/src/starcite/`
- `packages/python-sdk/tests/`

The monorepo is already structured so Python can be added without changing the TypeScript workspace layout.
